# Great-Circle-Distance

>#### [Great-Circle-Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) formula is used to find *distance between two points* on a *spherical surface*. Various applications where it is used is in navigation systems in Cars, Ship, etc.
>#### By using this concept we can find the nearest cabs available depending upon the coordinates of User.

The Algorithm finds the great circle distance of every cabs available in `input.json` file and and it returns the json data stored it in `output.json` file of those cab users whose distance is less than N (Here for example we have choose N=30Km)
